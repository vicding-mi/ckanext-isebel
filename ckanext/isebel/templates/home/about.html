At the moment, this search engine harvests folktales and metadata from five European regions: the Netherlands, Flanders, Denmark, North-East Germany and Iceland. The sources are the Folktale Database of the Low Countries, the Danish Folktale Database, WossiDia and Sagnagrunnur â€“ for now, the languages will be Dutch, Frisian, Flemish, Danish, (Low) German and Icelandic. The focus of [ISEBEL](http://isebel.eu/ "ISEBEL") is mainly on orally transmitted legends: traditional stories about ghosts, hauntings, devils, witches, wizards, spells, werewolves, nightmares, giants, trolls, goblins and the like, as well as stories about hidden treasures, famous robbers, underground passages and sunken castles. Queries can be made in English, or in the languages the stories are in; Boolean operators are allowed. Every story will have a link to the original database.' %}
